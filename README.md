# mayabot
Discord bot with tooling for the collaborative storytelling community

To install the project, run

```npm install```

There are two available scripts:

```npm run test``` 

This test script will run the Jest test suite and output relevant data.

```npm run build``` 

This build script will create a build.js based off of app.ts so that `index.html` can run.
